# Cache Issue Fix Summary

## Problem
`/admin` page showed fresh data but `/report` page showed stale/old data, even though both were using Supabase.

## Root Cause
Inconsistent use of Supabase clients across the codebase:
- Some functions used `supabase` (anon key) - subject to RLS and potential caching issues
- Some functions used `supabaseAdmin` (service role key) - bypasses RLS completely

This caused different parts of the app to see different data:
- `/admin` page was reading with `supabaseAdmin` → saw fresh data
- `/report` page was reading with `supabaseAdmin` → should see fresh data
- BUT: Other functions (updateRecord, deleteRecord, etc.) were using `supabase` → inconsistent behavior

## Solution
Updated ALL database functions to consistently use `supabaseAdmin`:

### Functions Updated:
1. ✅ `getReportSummary()` - Already using `supabaseAdmin`
2. ✅ `getAdminRecords()` - Already using `supabaseAdmin`
3. ✅ `updateRecord()` - **FIXED**: Now uses `supabaseAdmin`
4. ✅ `deleteRecord()` - **FIXED**: Now uses `supabaseAdmin`
5. ✅ `getDuplicateRecords()` - **FIXED**: Now uses `supabaseAdmin`
6. ✅ `updateRecordFlag()` - **FIXED**: Now uses `supabaseAdmin`
7. ✅ `getDailyTotalForUser()` - **FIXED**: Now uses `supabaseAdmin`
8. ✅ `getTotalCountForUser()` - **FIXED**: Now uses `supabaseAdmin`

### Function NOT Changed (Correctly using anon key):
- `submitTucSo()` - Uses `supabase` (anon key) for user submissions ✅

## Benefits
1. **Consistency**: All admin/report operations use the same privileged client
2. **No RLS Issues**: Service role key bypasses Row Level Security
3. **Fresh Data**: No caching issues from different client contexts
4. **Accurate Stats**: User stats in success modal now show correct counts

## Next Steps
**IMPORTANT**: You MUST redeploy to Vercel for these changes to take effect!

### Option 1: Automatic Deploy
The code is already pushed to main. If Vercel auto-deploys on push, it should deploy automatically.

### Option 2: Manual Redeploy
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Deployments
2. Click "..." on latest deployment
3. Click "Redeploy"

## Verification
After redeploying, check the logs for:

### ✅ Good Signs:
```
Environment check - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: Set
Getting report summary...
Using supabaseAdmin client to bypass RLS
All submissions fetched: XXX
```

### ❌ Bad Signs:
```
⚠️ SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY not set! Falling back to anon key.
```

If you see the warning, the environment variable is not set in Vercel.
