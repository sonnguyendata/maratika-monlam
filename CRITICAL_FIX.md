# ⚠️ CRITICAL BUG FIX APPLIED

## The Problem
Line 29 in `src/lib/database.ts` had:
```typescript
export const adminClient = supabase; // ❌ WRONG!
```

This was exporting `adminClient` as the regular `supabase` (anon key) instead of `supabaseAdmin` (service role key).

## Why This Matters
If ANY code in your codebase is using `adminClient` instead of `supabaseAdmin`, it would be using the anon key with RLS restrictions, which could cause:
- Stale/cached data
- Permission denied errors
- Inconsistent results between admin and report pages

## The Fix
Changed line 29 to:
```typescript
export const adminClient = supabaseAdmin; // ✅ CORRECT!
```

## Enhanced Logging
Added diagnostic logging to `getReportSummary()` that shows:
```
Using admin client: true (should be true for fresh data)
```

This will help you verify that the service role key is being used.

## Action Required

**YOU MUST REDEPLOY TO VERCEL NOW!**

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Deployments
2. Click "..." on the latest deployment  
3. Click "Redeploy"
4. Wait for deployment to complete
5. Visit `/report` page
6. Check browser console for the new logs

## Verification

After redeploying, look for these logs:

### ✅ GOOD (Service role key is working):
```
Environment check - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: Set
Using admin client: true (should be true for fresh data)
All submissions fetched: [actual number]
Final result - all_time: [actual count]
```

### ❌ BAD (Service role key is missing):
```
Environment check - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: Missing
Using admin client: false (should be true for fresh data)
⚠️ SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY not set! Falling back to anon key. This may cause RLS/cache issues.
```
