# Final Debug Steps

## Good News!

From your deployment logs, I can see:
- ✅ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set
- ✅ `supabaseAdmin` is different from `supabase`
- ✅ Database queries are working

## Now I Need Runtime Logs

The deployment logs show the build-time state. We need to see **runtime** logs when someone actually visits `/report`.

### Step 1: Check Vercel Function Logs

1. Go to **Vercel Dashboard**
2. Select your project
3. Click **"Deployments"** tab
4. Click on the **latest deployment**
5. Go to **"Functions"** tab
6. Find `/api/report/summary`
7. Click on it to see logs

**Look for these logs when you visit `/report`**:
```
Report summary API called at: [timestamp]
Getting report summary...
Environment check - SUPABASE_URL: Set
Environment check - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: Set
Using admin client: true (should be true for fresh data)
All submissions fetched: [number]
Final result - all_time: [number] today: [number] unique: [number]
```

### Step 2: Visit Debug Endpoint

Visit: `https://maratika-monlam.vercel.app/api/debug/report-test`

**Send me the JSON response** - especially:
- `usingAdminClient` value
- `results.adminClient.count`
- `results.anonClient.count`

### Step 3: Compare Counts

1. Visit `/admin` - what's the total count shown?
2. Visit `/report` - what's the total count shown?
3. **Are they different?** If yes, by how much?

### Step 4: Check Browser Console

1. Visit `/report`
2. Open DevTools (F12) → Console
3. **Copy all the logs** and send them to me

## What To Look For

**If logs show**:
- `usingAdminClient: false` → Environment variable not loading at runtime
- `All submissions fetched: 0` → Query is returning wrong data
- Different counts → Need to see the actual query results

## Most Likely Issue Now

Since build logs show the key is set, but `/report` shows old data, it's likely:

**The Supabase query itself is returning old data** OR **there's a timezone mismatch**

The logs you send will reveal which one.
